        <h1>Uta</h1>
        <img src="./images/Uta.jpg" alt="Uta">
        <p>Uta is an old friend of Renji Yomo and Itori. He owns the HySy ArtMask Studio, where he sells bespoke masks. In his teenage years, he was known as No Face to the CCG investigators in the 4th ward.
        </p>
        <p>He has a lot of piercings and tattoos on his body, making him look pretty intimidating, even as a normal-looking human. He's the one who also made a mask for Kaneki.</p>
        <p>The tattoo on his neck is a Latin quote written in Greek letters which reads, "I can live neither with you, nor without you."</p>
        <p>He has a very nice way of speaking and seems to be friendly. Although his expression almost never changes, he has an amusing way of teasing people.</p>
